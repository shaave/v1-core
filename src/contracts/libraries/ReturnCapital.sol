    * @dev This function is used to calculate the amount of collateral (in Wei) that can be withdrawn at any given sell event.
    *      It's structured to always withdraw the maximum amount of collateral from Aave with a 10% buffer (to prevent damaging
    *      the child contract's health factor on Aaave), such that the debt-to-collateral ratio remains below 70% (Aave's max 
    *      is 80% for USDC).
    * @param _childAddress The address of the contract that's attempting to withdraw collateral.
    * @return withdrawalAmount The amount of collateral (in Wei) to be withdrawn to the user.
    * @notice totalCollateralBase The total collateral supplied on the child contract's behalf (must multiply by 1e10 to get Wei)
    * @notice totalDebtBase The total debt value, as measured in base tokens, across all borrowed assets (must multiply by 1e10 to get Wei)
    * @notice maxWithdrawal The maximum amount of collateral (in Wei) that can be withdrawn without the debt-to-collateral ratio
    *                       becoming greater than 70%. Since Aave's getUserAccountData() returns totalCollateralBase and
    *                       totalDebtBase as (Ether * 1e8) units, it's possible for debt smaller than 1e10 Wei to exist,
    *                       which would cause the contract to attempt to widthraw more collateral than Aave allows. Since,
    *                       this would cause a transaction reversion, we must leave enough collateral to back any uncaptured
    *                       debt (smaller than 1e10 Wei).
